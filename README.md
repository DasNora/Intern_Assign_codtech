DOMAIN: SQL
DURATION: 6 WEEKS

During my SQL internship at CODTECH, I successfully completed all four required tasks using both MySQL and PostgreSQL. These tasks involved working on core database concepts such as joins, advanced data analysis, database migration, and backup & recovery. Throughout the internship, I applied theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, enhancing my hands-on skills in SQL and database management systems.

Task 1: Joins Practice
For this task, I performed various types of SQL joins—INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN—to combine data from multiple tables meaningfully. I created sample tables with relevant fields, inserted mock data, and wrote queries to extract combined information across different scenarios. For example, INNER JOIN was used to retrieve matching records between tables, while LEFT and RIGHT JOINS helped display unmatched rows from one table with corresponding matches from another. FULL OUTER JOINs were implemented in PostgreSQL to combine all records from both tables with NULLs in place where no matches existed. This task helped me strengthen my ability to understand and handle relational data across different schemas.

Task 2: Advanced Data Analysis with SQL
The second task required the use of subqueries, window functions, and common table expressions (CTEs) for advanced analysis. I created analytical queries that calculated running totals, moving averages, rank-based ordering, and conditional aggregations. Using window functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and SUM() OVER(PARTITION BY ...), I explored patterns within grouped data. CTEs were used to build readable multi-step queries, improving clarity and efficiency. This task sharpened my skills in writing optimized SQL for data exploration and reporting, applicable in real-world data analytics roles.

Task 3: Database Migration (MySQL to PostgreSQL)
One of the most insightful tasks was migrating a complete database from MySQL to PostgreSQL. I used mysqldump to export the database schema and data from MySQL and then converted the dump into PostgreSQL-compatible format. Tools like pgloader and custom scripts helped in data type mapping and schema conversion. I ensured the integrity of the migrated data by validating table structures, checking row counts, and testing queries in the new PostgreSQL environment. This task gave me hands-on experience in cross-platform data migration and understanding differences between SQL dialects.

Task 4: Database Backup and Recovery
In the final task, I demonstrated how to back up a database and restore it in case of failure. For MySQL, I used mysqldump to generate backup files and mysql command-line tools for restoration. In PostgreSQL, I used pg_dump for backups and pg_restore for restoring from custom-format backups. I also documented each step of the process, including commands and scenarios for partial or full recovery. This task emphasized the importance of disaster recovery planning in database administration.

Overall, the internship allowed me to apply both MySQL and PostgreSQL to real-world problems. It enhanced my understanding of relational databases, query optimization, cross-platform compatibility, and data security practices. All tasks were completed independently, with the help of online resources, and submitted via a well-documented GitHub repository.
